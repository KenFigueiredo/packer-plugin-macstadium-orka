Packer Builder Plugin for Orka
==============================

This is a [Packer Builder] plugin to automate building images for [MacStadium Orka],
a Kubernetes/Docker-based macOS virtualization PaaS/SaaS service by [MacStadium].

# Compatibility

For this plugin to function you need to have at least Packer 1.6.0 installed and
Orka CLI 1.3.0. The Orka CLI is optional as of v2.0.0 but is highly recommended to allow
you to access the Orka API for other tasks (such as tweaking, deleting or managing the
VMs and images) whilst building your packer logic via this plugin.

 * **[Packer Downloads]** - 1.6.0+
 * **[Orka CLI Downloads]** (Optional)  - 1.3.0+

# Install / Setup

1. Install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads.html).
2. (Optional) Install [Orka CLI](https://orkadocs.macstadium.com/docs/downloads).
3. Setup Orka CLI - See: [Orka Setup Guide].
3. Download the [Latest Release] of this plugin.
4. Rename the binary to `packer-builder-macstadium-orka`, then move it to a location
    where [Packer] will detect them at run-time, such as any of the following:
    * The directory where the [packer] binary is.
    * The `~/.packer.d/plugins` directory.
    * The current working directory.
5. Ensure that you make this downloaded file executable and that it runs on your
    machine. For OS-X you may need to remove a the quarantine bit with the following:
    ```bash
    # On every Unix-ey OS you'll need to chmod it
    chmod a+x ~/.packer.d/plugins/packer-builder-macstadium-orka
    # On Macs because of a security system in place, you will need to un-quarantine it
    xattr -d ~/.packer.d/plugins/com.apple.quarantine/packer-builder-macstadium-orka
    # If you try to run it on every os it should work but report that you shouldn't run plugins directly
    ~/.packer.d/plugins/com.apple.quarantine/packer-builder-macstadium-orka
    panic: Please do not execute plugins directly. Packer will execute these for you.
    ```
  6. Change to a directory where you have [packer] templates, and packer run as usual,
      but using the `macstadium-orka` as the builder, per the example below.

# Packer Builder Configuration

```json
{
  "builders": [{
    "type": "macstadium-orka",
    "source_image": "name-of-image-from-vm-images-list",
    "image_name": "destination-image-name"
  }]
}
```
---

* `type` _(string)_ **(required)**

Must be `macstadium-orka`

* `source_image` _(string)_ **(required)**

This is the source image (vm config) we will be using to launch the VM from. This should
be an entry from `orka vm configs`. If you don't have one or need to create one, here's
an example. The "base-image" in the below command is looked up from `orkaÂ image list`.
See [examples below](#Example-Commands)

* `image_name` _(string)_ (optional)

This is the destination name of the image that will be created.  The image will be located inside `orka image list` when completed.  If not specified this will be autogenerated to the following: `packer-{{unix timestamp}}`

* `image_precopy` _(boolean)_ (optional) (default: false)

This enables the pre-copy mode that will create a complete duplicate of the
`source_image` above and save it to the new `image_name` before running any of the
provisioners. When the provisioners are complete, it will run the commit image API
method instead of the save image API method. *This mode can be handy when the delta
between the source and the destination will be very large and may cause the new image
save operation to take too long at the end of provisioning. Although it has been our
experience this is not really necessary some users may wish to essentially "front-load"
the waiting time when building/provisioning VMs in Orka.*

## Development / Internal Options

If you're NOT a developer working on this software you can ignore the following.

But, if you are building/editing/updating this software, you may want to turn on most or all of the following options.  See the [examples/macos-catalina.json](./examples/macos-catalina.json).

* `simulate_create` _(boolean)_ (optional) _*- for devs*_

This is for internal development purposes, to prevent having to constantly create VMs for testing/development of this plugin.  Not for normal use.  The simulated "example" is hardcoded into the code on line 90 of [builder/orka/step_orka_create.go](./builder/orka/step_orka_create.go).  Feel free to edit during local development for your environment, but do not submit a commit/MR editing this please.

* `do_not_delete` _(boolean)_ (optional) _*- for devs*_

By default this plugin automatically deletes the VM afterwards if all scripts ran successfully.  AFAIK there is no mechanism built-into Packer to "force" it to not delete the source VM afterwards, so this fills that gap.  This is useful for debugging builds that are being weird, but is generally not intended for noraml use.  You should just use the resulting image.

* `do_not_image` _(boolean)_ (optional) _*- for devs*_

By default this plugin automatically creates an image of the VM after any provisioning
steps. AFAIK there is no mechanism built-into Packer to "force" it to not image the VM
afterwards, so this fills that gap. This is useful for debugging builds that are being
weird, but is generally not intended for noraml use.

# Example Orka Commands (CLI)

These aren't directly related to this plugin, exactly, but they're a bit of a simplified
guide to get you started. For a more full guide see: [Orka Setup Guide].

```bash
# Create a config which is used for source_image above
orka vm create-config -v macos-catalina-10-15-5 -c 3 --C 3 --vnc --base-image macos-catalina-10.15.5.img -y

# In essence, this plugin automates running the following 3 commands...
# Start a VM (using the config above)
orka vm deploy -v macos-catalina-10-15-5 --vnc -y

# Save a VM's disk to a disk image
orka image save -v <vmid-here-from-orka-vm-list> -b <destination-image-name> -y

# Stop and remove a VM
orka vm delete --vm <vmid-here-from-orka-vm-list> -y

# Later to launch future images with this image create a new config to launch...
orka vm create-config -v my-new-packerified-vm -c 3 --C 3 --vnc --base-image <destination-image-name> -y
# And launch it...
orka vm deploy -v my-new-packerified-vm --vnc -y
# Or, alternatively if you're done working with an image and want to delete it...
orka image delete --image <destination-image-name> -y
```

# Changelog / History
 * [v2.2.1] - Add better error handling when using the save or commit endpoints to
    ensure that the build halts and errors as well.
 * [v2.0.0] - Refactored to use the Orka API directly as opposed to having to wrap the
    CLI tool.
 * [v1.0.0] - Initial Public Release
   * Basic functionality wrapper around Orka CLI
   * Setup Github Action to automatically build and release

# Development / Bugs / Support

If you want to help contribute to this plugin or find a bug, please [file an issue] on
GitHub, and/or submit a PR. This is Open Source, so don't expect to have bugs fixed
immediately, but we will try our best to reasonably support this plugin. Contributors
are always welcome though.

To get a development environment up will need a recent golang installed and setup.  Then with a single make command below command it will build, install, and try to run the example at [examples/macos-catalina.json](./examples/macos-catalina.json).  You may need to edit this file to have the source VM config that you have locally, as it is hardcoded to my environment's image `macos-catalina-10-15-5` at the moment.

```bash
make fresh
```

Finally, if you want to support me or any of the developers of this project in some way,
please donate to a local animal shelter or makerspace or one of many open-source
projects that you rely on regularly.

# TODO (In No Particular Order)

These are a list of things that are pending to accomplish within this repo. Contributors
are welcome.

 * Add tests. This should be a higher priority first though, as this is important to
    keep this plugin functional and debugging issues.
 * Consider implementing for this plugin to automatically create a VM config for
    launching a VM, and possibly after tied to the image just created.
 * Random thought related to the immediate above feature, maybe this plugin to be able
    to scan configs and/or images available and automatically use the first one it
    finds, possibly creating a new config specifically for the image? If it'd make it
    easier? Let's explore and discuss this with some other users if this would be useful
    and how best to do it.
 * Clean up / improve code / catch more sharp edges and edge-cases, deal with any issues
    filed on GitHub.
 * One day, get this merged upstream into Packer as an official builder.
